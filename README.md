# AI-Based Beach Surveillance System

This project implements an AI-driven surveillance system to enhance safety on public beaches. The system monitors people near the sea, detects boundary limit crossings, and issues timely alerts to prevent potential dangers.

## Features
- **Live Video Analysis**: Processes real-time video streams from surveillance cameras.
- **Boundary Limit Detection**: Identifies if individuals cross a predefined safe zone.
- **Automated Alerts**: Triggers audio, visual, or SMS alerts when limits are breached.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Can be adapted to different beach layouts and monitoring scales.

## Technologies Used
- **Deep Learning**: YOLOv8 for object detection.
- **OpenCV**: Video stream processing.
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Flask/Django**: Backend for API and alert systems.
- **Twilio**: SMS alert integration (optional).
